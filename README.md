**Join Discord:** [https://discord.gg/wVDEm7jzJe](https://discord.gg/wVDEm7jzJe)
**Events on Meetup.com**: [https://www.meetup.com/web3devs-community/](https://www.meetup.com/web3devs-community/)

**Repository** https://github.com/web3devscommunity/you-will-never-rust-alone

### **tldr;**

- It‚Äôs 80% study, 20% social
- it‚Äôs like an Agile standup, progress update + time for self-study, then exchange for knowledge.
- it‚Äôs regular, hybrid lightweight Saturday morning session.
    - Momentum is what in need as learning Rust is a long journey

## Venue
- Always Hybrid
    - Online always welcome - Want everyone to keep up wherever you are
- If you‚Äôre in SG, debuggingfuture is most likely working from here IRL (Pls confirm on discord)
    - [MetaCamp](https://goo.gl/maps/qazaTheZiSKmN6Yz9)
        - Shout out to them Sponsoring the venue

## Agenda
- 1030 Check-in
- 1045 Work üöÄüöÄüöÄ
- 1245-1300 Regroup & Sharings

### Ideas to work on

- read a chapter of book / a video, write a summary & share to the community on discord / twitter
- many resources in the channel
- try out a sdk / library and do a demo
- BYOP bring your own project in rust
- we plan to build web3dev.community website with tickets feature, open source using [YEW](https://yew.rs/)

### Resources

- for beginner (never read abt borrow/ownership)
    - https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings
    - [https://exercism.org/tracks/rust](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust)
- Resources for intermediate (know the basics, need more practices)
    - 10 videos to watch

## Check-in

- write on discord with below template
- Motivation & Keep it up is the most important goal

```markdown
Template (with example)
 

**What I'm going to do**
- minsweeper
- rustup exercises/move_semantics

**What areas I might need help**
- studying examples for "Move", "Borrow" concept 

**Anything I plan to share**
- Pattern matching in rust (5min)

**Resources**
- https://users.rust-lang.org/t/rust-mutability-moving-and-borrowing-the-straight-dope/22166
- Programming Rust Ch.6
```

## if you have any Questions

Post on #rust discord channel, the group and the mentors will try to get back to you!

## Regroup & Sharings

- what I learnt
- other sharings
- mentor feedback

```markdown
Template (with example)
 

**What I did/learnt**
- mechanisms of Macro
- rustlings macros/, Programming Rust Ch 21

**Anything to share**
- 1) On Rust Macro
- Comparing vs decorator https://users.rust-lang.org/t/are-derive-macros-in-rust-similar-to-decorators-in-python/46686
- Anchor's usage https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor/blob/master/lang/derive/accounts/src/lib.rs
- Macro is really powerful. There are a lot of usage in Solana Anchor framework, 
which helped to make complicated code really clean and easy to understand.
- It's in the category of metaprogramming, while very integrated with the language
(many languages got some, while groovy is a nice example)
- "Macro template are simialr to template language in web, just output rust code" -- p.603 Programming Rust
- I read parts of the book before, but I realize without practice or active project it's a bit hard to remmeber 
or sink in, esp since most of us dont use rust at production. (Thus momentum is really key)
- Basic examples: https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/macros.html
- Deep Dive: https://www.edx.org/course/compilers
- 2) on functional programming vs typescript

**Any Help you need**
- Inspire me with fun macro use cases~~~
```

We want everyone to practice explaining their code, which is not only abt presentation skills,
but think more thoroughly (google "rubber duck debugging")

- What I learnt (100 words+ / 3min+ presentations in call or loom)
- show & Tell - Code Examples
- always try to post to the #rust channel too
- Questions (write on discord )
- In case anyone have to go early, you can also use loom

## Community-driven: How to Organize / Logistics the meetup

Try to document such that we could self-organize

- Steps
    - Venue check
    - Create a discord thread on #rust channel for checkin
    - tweet & noitfy if we got a place IRL
    - host the checkin / sharing calls
    - Call for mentors
    - Consolidate any looms or resources
- Prefer Discord first ‚Üí documentation for better engagement
    - will move to more real-time open source collaborative platform soon
        - try to do github
